# Registers

### Data Registers : 
are usually used for storing instructions/syscall arguments.

#### primary data registers
- rax
- rbx
- rcx
- rdx 	
#### secondary data registers
- r8
- r9
- r10


### Pointer Registers :
are used to store specific important address pointers.
- **Base Stack Pointer rbp** which points to the beginning of the Stack
- **the Current Stack Pointer rsp** which points to the current location within the Stack (top of the Stack). 
- **Instruction Pointer rip** which holds the address of the next instruction.
