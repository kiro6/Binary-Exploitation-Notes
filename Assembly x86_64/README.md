# Registers

### Data Registers : 
are usually used for storing instructions/syscall arguments.

#### primary data registers
- rax
- rbx
- rcx
- rdx 	
#### secondary data registers
- r8
- r9
- r10


### Pointer Registers :
are used to store specific important address pointers.
- **Base Stack Pointer rbp** which points to the beginning of the Stack
- **the Current Stack Pointer rsp** which points to the current location within the Stack (top of the Stack). 
- **Instruction Pointer rip** which holds the address of the next instruction.



### the essential registers and sub-registers in an x86_64 architecture

| Description                  | 64-bit Register | 32-bit Register | 16-bit Register | 8-bit Register |
|------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Data/Arguments Registers** |

| 6th arg                      | r9              | r9d             | r9w             | r9b            |
| **Pointer Registers**        |
| Base Stack Pointer           | rbp             | ebp             | bp              | bpl            |
| Current/Top Stack Pointer    | rsp             | esp             | sp              | spl            |
| Instruction Pointer 'call only'| rip           | eip             | ip              | ipl            |

# Memory Addresses
x86 64-bit processors have 64-bit wide addresses that range from 0x0 to 0xffffffffffffffff

### types of address fetching (i.e., addressing modes) in the x86 architecture:
lower is slower. The less immediate the value is, the slower it is to fetch it.

| Addressing Mode | Description                                     | Example                           |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Immediate       | The value is given within the instruction       | `add 2`                           |
| Register        | The register name that holds the value          | `add rax`                         |
| Direct          | The direct full address is given               | `call 0xffffffffaa8a25ff`        |
| Indirect        | A reference pointer is given                    | `call 0x44d000` or `call [rax]`   |
| Stack           | Address is on top of the stack                  | `add rsp`                         |
